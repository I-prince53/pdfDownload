4. Buses
A bus is a communication pathway for transferring data between components in a computer system. There are three main types of buses:

a. Address Bus
- Definition: Specifies the address of the memory location or I/O device involved in the data transfer.
- Characteristics:
  - Unidirectional: Data flows only from the CPU to memory or I/O devices.
  - Width Impact: Determines the number of memory locations that can be addressed (e.g., a 32-bit address bus can address 2^32 memory locations).

b. Data Bus
- Definition: Transfers actual data between the CPU, memory, and I/O devices.
- Characteristics:
  - Bidirectional: Data can flow to and from the CPU.
  - Width Impact: Determines the amount of data transferred in one operation (e.g., a 64-bit data bus can transfer 64 bits at a time).

c. Control Bus
- Definition: Carries control signals to manage the activities of all connected components.
- Functions:
  - Specifies operations like read, write, or interrupt.
  - Ensures synchronization between the CPU, memory, and I/O devices.

Adders
An adder is a digital circuit used in electronics and computer systems to perform the arithmetic operation of addition. Adders are a fundamental building block in arithmetic logic units (ALUs) within a CPU and are essential for performing calculations.

Types of Adders
1. Half Adder
- Definition: A half adder is a combinational circuit that performs the addition of two single-bit binary numbers (A and B).
- Outputs:
  - Sum (S): S = A XOR B
  - Carry (C): C = A AND B

2. Full Adder
- Definition: A full adder adds three single-bit binary numbers: two operands (A and B) and a carry bit (Cin) from a previous operation.
- Outputs:
  - Sum (S): S = A XOR B XOR Cin
  - Carry (Cout): Cout = (A AND B) + (B AND Cin) + (A AND Cin)

Multibit Adders
a. Ripple Carry Adder
- Definition: A chain of full adders used to add multi-bit binary numbers.
- Working: The carry-out of each full adder is connected to the carry-in of the next adder.
- Limitation: Ripple carry adders are slow for large numbers because the carry must propagate through all stages.

b. Carry Lookahead Adder
- Definition: A faster type of adder that reduces the delay caused by carry propagation in a ripple carry adder.
- Working: It uses logic to calculate carry bits in advance, based on the inputs.
- Advantage: Much faster for large numbers compared to ripple carry adders.

Memory Hierarchy
Memory hierarchy refers to the organization of different types of memory based on speed and size. The idea is to use faster but smaller memory (like registers and cache) for frequently accessed data, while slower but larger memory (like secondary storage) holds less frequently accessed data.

Memory Hierarchy Levels:
1. Registers
The smallest and fastest type of memory located directly inside the CPU. Registers hold data that is actively being processed by the CPU.
Example: Program counters, accumulator registers.

2. Cache Memory
Cache memory stores frequently accessed data and instructions to speed up processing. It is smaller and faster than main memory.

Control Unit (CU)
The Control Unit (CU) is a crucial component of the Central Processing Unit (CPU). It retrieves instructions from memory, decodes them, and sends control signals to various parts of the CPU, coordinating their actions.

Types of Control Units
1. Hardwired Control
- Definition: Control signals are generated by fixed circuits based on the current instruction in the instruction register.
- Advantages:
  - Faster: Signals are generated immediately by the hardware.
  - Simple Design: Suitable for simple architectures.
- Disadvantages:
  - Inflexible: Difficult to modify for new instructions or architectures.
  - Complexity for Complex Systems: Hard to design for large instruction sets.

2. Microprogrammed Control
- Definition: Control signals are generated by a sequence of micro-operations stored as microinstructions in memory.
- Advantages:
  - Flexible: Easier to modify without hardware changes.
  - Easier to Design: Suitable for complex instruction sets.
- Disadvantages:
  - Slower: Fetching microinstructions takes time.
